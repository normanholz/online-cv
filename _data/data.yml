      - role: Senior Full Stack Engineer
        time: Feb 2021 - Apr 2022
        company: LifeBonus, Hamburg, Germany
        details: |
          As a dedicated Full Stack Software Engineer at LifeBonus, I had the privilege of being part of a dynamic team 
          that developed a cutting-edge cross-platform React Native application aimed at enhancing the proficiency of 
          professional caregivers in safe and proper patient movement. My role encompassed a spectrum of 
          responsibilities that allowed me to make a significant impact and drive remarkable achievements. 
          
          One of the standout accomplishments during my tenure was spearheading the integration of a robust video 
          uploading feature within the application. This feature served as a pivotal tool for the AI department, 
          enabling them to gather essential sample data crucial for training neural networks. 
          
          I also had the distinct honor of contributing extensively to user research efforts, enabling the acquisition of crucial data that 
          facilitated the optimization of user engagement and retention strategies. 
          
          In addition, I played a pivotal role in a comprehensive design and user experience overhaul. Drawing from my mobile development expertise, 
          I championed a radical revamp of the onboarding process. Through meticulous design and strategic development, 
          we successfully simplified and enhanced the user onboarding journey, making it more intuitive and seamless. 
          
          My commitment to excellence extended beyond development tasks. I provided instrumental guidance to the management team in effectively positioning and monetizing the product 
          within the market. By leveraging cloud-native solutions through AWS, including Amplify, S3, Cognito, and 
          DynamoDB I helped to ensure the scalability, security, and performance of our application.
      - role: Senior Mobile Application Engineer (Freelance)
        time: Apr 2012 - Jul 2014
        company: Hanseatic Bank GmbH & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany
        details: |
          As a dedicated freelance Mobile Application Engineer at Hanseatic Bank, I embarked on an exciting journey to 
          shape the future of digital banking experiences. Collaborating closely with a skilled counterpart, 
          I had the privilege of spearheading the creation of the credit card self-service app from the ground up, 
          leveraging cutting-edge technologies to achieve remarkable results.
          
          Utilizing React Native as our foundation, combined with the power of TypeScript and Storybook, we architected 
          a robust and user-friendly mobile app available on both iOS and Android platforms.
          
          One of the pivotal highlights of my tenure was the successful integration of Apple Pay and Google Pay into the 
          application. In a landscape where innovation was paramount, I ensured that Hanseatic Bank customers enjoyed 
          the convenience of seamless mobile payments through these prominent providers. 
          This achievement set us ahead of the curve, as other institutions were still grappling with the complexities 
          of this integration.
          
          I took a proactive role in ensuring the app's longevity and seamless transition beyond my tenure. 
          With a strategic focus on sustainable development practices, I successfully onboarded and nurtured a 
          proficient development team. This initiative ensured the app's ongoing maintenance and evolution.

          Key Achievements:
            - Led the end-to-end development of the credit card self-service app using React Native, TypeScript, and Storybook for iOS and Android platforms.
            - Pioneered the seamless integration of Apple Pay and Google Pay, setting a benchmark for customer-centric mobile payment experiences.
            - Successfully onboarded and empowered a development team to ensure the app's continuous enhancement and maintenance.
            - Automated continuous delivery processes, optimizing deployment workflows for efficiency and reliability.

      - role: Interim Chief Technology Officer
        time: May 2016 - Dec 2018
        company: Hamburg Startup, Hamburg, Germany
        details: |
          As the Interim Chief Technology Officer at Hamburg Startups, I undertook a pivotal role in transforming the 
          software product "Hamburg Startup Monitor." This dynamic platform, initially developed by multiple freelancers, 
          was designed to comprehensively list and foster connections among startups within the Hamburg region.
          
          Taking the helm of the entire software ecosystem, I steered the ship of frontend and backend development, 
          in addition to overseeing infrastructure and server maintenance. A significant milestone I achieved was the 
          successful implementation of a robust multi-tenancy framework. This innovation enabled the seamless 
          deployment of analogous products tailored to diverse geographical areas across Germany, 
          as well as specialized versions like a Startup Monitor focused on empowering female founders.
          
          Amidst relentless innovation, I spearheaded the introduction of new features that elevated the user 
          experience and extended the platform's capabilities. Beyond this, I orchestrated the automation of data 
          exports for external data analytics service providers, streamlining processes and enhancing data-driven insights.
          
          My strategic acumen came to the fore as I advised the company on a pivotal pivot in the product strategy. 
          This strategic shift was essential to ensure sustained viability and profitability in a dynamic market landscape. 
          My insights and guidance contributed to the company's ability to navigate challenges effectively and seize 
          emerging opportunities.
          
          My tenure as Interim CTO at HamburgStartups was marked by a passion for technological excellence and a 
          dedication to driving meaningful outcomes. I relished the opportunity to shape a transformative product and 
          contribute to the growth of the startup ecosystem.
      - role: Senior iOS Engineer (Freelance)
        time: Apr 2016 - Apr 2018
        company: Group Story Social Media Platform, Hamburg, Germany
        details: |
          At “Group Social Media Platform”, I collaborated with another highly skilled iOS developer to transform a 
          promising prototype into a cutting-edge mobile application. During my tenure, I not only contributed to 
          numerous redesigns but also pioneered innovative solutions that significantly enhanced the app's functionality 
          and user experience.
          
          Taking over the reins from an external US-based agency, I spearheaded the complete overhaul of the app using 
          both Objective-C and Swift, ensuring a robust foundation for future development.
          
          One of the marquee accomplishments during my time was the implementation of a comprehensive in-app video 
          editing solution. This solution revolutionized collaborative video editing, enabling groups to collectively 
          refine and approve videos within the app. The complexity of the task escalated as I developed a sophisticated 
          mechanism for adding diverse text overlays, encompassing both handwritten and typed text, along with images. 
          Additionally, the solution seamlessly integrated watermarking, adding a layer of professionalism to the edited videos.
          
          To streamline user interactions, I introduced concurrent and resumable video upload functionalities. 
          These enhancements not only simplified the video sharing process but also fostered an intuitive user experience, 
          ultimately boosting user engagement.
          
          Innovation extended beyond code as I automated the continuous delivery pipeline of the iOS app using pioneering 
          tools like BuddyBuild. This proactive approach ensured a rapid and reliable distribution of updates to our valued customers, 
          underscoring our commitment to excellence.
          
          Throughout my assignment, I steadfastly maintained a dual focus on propelling the app with cutting-edge features 
          and fortifying its codebase for ongoing adaptability. This balance was essential as the team received a 
          barrage of feature requests and frequent adjustments from product management, 
          which I confidently addressed without compromising the application's stability.

          During my tenure as a Staff Software Engineer at CompleteGenomics, a distinguished biotech company specializing in Genome Sequencing, I played a pivotal role in driving innovation and efficiency in the field of consumer genetic data analysis.
          
          Originally brought on board as an iOS Developer for the self-service genome analysis product, I embraced versatility and transitioned seamlessly into a backend developer role as business requirements evolved.
          
          My primary focus revolved around developing and optimizing complex data processing and transformation pipelines tailored for vast genomic datasets. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, such as node.js and MongoDB, I architected robust solutions that efficiently managed the enormous volumes of genetic information.
